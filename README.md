# Language Guided Concept Bottleneck Models for Interpretable Continual Learning
The official PyTorch implementation of CVPR2025 paper "Language Guided Concept Bottleneck Models for Interpretable Continual Learning"

We follow the [PyCIL](https://github.com/G-U-N/PyCIL) implement this project.

## Environment preparation

## Dataset preparation
We evaluated our approch on 3 coarse-grained datasets: CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, ImageNet100; and 4 fine-grained datasets: CUB-200, Flower102, Food101, Stanford-cars.
## Concept preparation

## Model training
